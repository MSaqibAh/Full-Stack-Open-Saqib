        <h2>Writing Poetry for Beginners</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Too often, new writers associate poetry with some of the most complicated and foreign poetic movements. No longer
        is poetry just Whitman, Blake, or Keats. Poetry has evolved in many ways, making it more accessible than ever to
        beginners. This is writing poetry for beginners.</p>
    <h3>Common Types of Poetry</h3>
    <p>There are various types of poetry, but that doesn’t mean you have to only write one or that you must follow all
        of the “rules.” Here are a few different types of poetry that you should become familiar with, especially when
        you’re a beginner. </p>
    <h4>Prose Poetry</h4>
    <p>Prose poetry has steadily been rising in popularity, and is perhaps one of the most accessible forms for beginner
        poets. This type of poetry is written in prose sentences, but can adopt many of the common attributes of poetry.
        For example, prose poems might focus on sound, tone, symbolism, metaphor, or a specific theme.</p>
    <a href="https://poets.org/poem/list-famous-hats" target="_blank"><i>List of Famous Hats</i></a>, by by James Tate
    is an excellent example of a prose poem.
    <p>
    <blockquote cite="https://poets.org/poem/list-famous-hats"><i>Napoleon’s hat is an obvious choice I guess to list as
            a famous hat, but that’s not the hat I have in mind. That was his hat for show. I am thinking of his private
            bathing cap, which in all honesty wasn’t much different than the one any jerk might buy at a corner
            drugstore now, except for two minor eccentricities. The first one isn’t even funny: Simply it was a white
            rubber bathing cap, but too small. Napoleon led such a hectic life ever since his childhood, even farther
            back than that, that he never had a chance to buy a new bathing cap and still as a grown-up--well, he didn’t
            really grow that much, but his head did: He was a pinhead at birth, and he used, until his death really, the
            same little tiny bathing cap that he was born in, and this meant that later it was very painful to him and
            gave him many headaches, as if he needed more. So, he had to vaseline his skull like crazy to even get the
            thing on. The second eccentricity was that it was a tricorn bathing cap. Scholars like to make a lot out of
            this, and it would be easy to do. My theory is simple-minded to be sure: that beneath his public head there
            was another head and it was a pyramid or something.
        </i></blockquote>
    </p>
    <h3>Narrative Poetry </h3>
    <p>If you read poetry, you’ve definitely read narrative poetry. This type of poetry, generally has an arch, a strong
        narrative voice, and a plot regardless of the length. </p>
    <p>These poems can range in form and length. While they may “sound” like more complicated forms of poetry, they tend
        to be easier to follow.</p>
    <h3>Sonnet</h3>
    <p>Ever heard of William Shakespeare? Well, he’s the King of Sonnets. This type of poetry follows a specific form.
        Made up of 14 lines, iambic meter, and a ending rhyme scheme, sonnets are a more traditional type of poetry.
    </p>
    <p>Enjoy <a href="https://shakespeare.mit.edu/Poetry/sonnet.XXII.html" target="_blank">Sonnet XXII></a>, by
        Shakespeare</p>
    <pre>
        My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
        So long as youth and thou are of one date;
        But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
        Then look I death my days should expiate.
        For all that beauty that doth cover thee
        Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
        Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
        How can I then be elder than thou art?
        O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary
        As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
        Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
        As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
        Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;
        Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again.</pre>
    <h3>Epic Poetry</h3>
    <p>The hero’s journey is encapsulated in epic poetry. Epic poems are longer, and follow the trials and tribulations
        of a heroine. Many epics are rooted in mythology - this is why you may be familiar with some of them. </p>
    <p>Homer's <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/Odyssey-Homer/dp/1490516425/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&keywords=The%20odyssey&linkCode=ur2&qid=1424828289&sr=8-2&tag=qwiklitcom-20&linkId=PU6C57VHGEJTQ5PY"
            target="_blank">The Odyssey</a> is an example of an epic poem.</p>
    <h3>Free Verse Poetry</h3>
    <p>Ready to throw rules out the window? Free verse poetry follows no particular format, rhyme scheme, tone, or
        pattern. As a beginner, free verse is a fun way to start writing poetry because it does not place any
        limitations on the writer. </p>
    <h3>Want to Write Good Poetry? Follow These Rules</h3>
    <p><img src="writing-for-begginers.png" alt="want to write a good poetry"
            style="float:right;width:250px;height:150px;"> Being a poet requires more than writing (yes, it’s true). By
        adopting some of these rules into your routine, you can ensure that your poetry grows and develops.</p>
    <h3>1.) Read Poetry </h3>
    <p>While this sounds obvious, you’d be surprised to learn that few poets READ a lot of poetry. If you want to become
        a famous poet, you need to read the poets who can come before you. </p>
    <p>Reading poetry can also help you identify which styles of poetry you’re interested in writing. Plus, it’s a great
        way to get inspired when <a
            href="https://www.fromwhisperstoroars.com/blog-1/2018/3/1/dancing-in-the-dark-with-writers-block"
            target="_blank"> writer's block</a> inevitably creeps out its head. </p>
    <p>If you’re having trouble finding a great poetry book, or don’t want to commit to a collection of only one author,
        we highly recommend anthologies (our editor’s favorite is the The Penguin Anthology of Twentieth-Century
        American Poets). </p>
    <h3>2.) Attend or Watch Local Poetry Slams / Groups</h3>
    <p>Creative spaces help to cultivate and hone your poetic style. We highly recommend you get involved in your local
        creative scene. This means attending poetry readings, joining a local writers or readers group, and maybe even
        sharing and editing your work in a workshop. </p>
    <p>If you’re unable to connect with local poets, there are numerous spaces online to do so. Instagram, Twitter, and
        Medium are welcoming spaces for new poets and writers. From prompts, to resources and encouragement, you can
        find fellow poets online that can help keep you focused and driven in your pursuit to be a poet. You can follow
        us on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/fwtr_litmag" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a
            href="https://www.instagram.com/fromwhisperstoroars" target="_blank">Instagram</a> as well!</p>
    <p>This practice benefits poets in two ways. First, it encourages you to write due to the accountability factor.
        Second, it makes writing more community-driven versus you, being in a room, banging your head on the desk
        because you’re not feeling inspired. </p>
    <h3>How to Start A Poem</h3>
    <p><img src="blog-how-to-start-a-poem.jpg" alt="How to start a poem" style="float:right;width:250px;height:150px;">
        Many people want to write poetry, but they don’t know where to start. Luckily, it’s pretty easy to start a poem.
    </p>
    <p>Do you write in other <a href="https://www.fromwhisperstoroars.com/blog-1/2018/8/22/creating-a-fictional-place"
            target="_blank">genres</a>? If so, what themes and topics do you usually explore? </p>
    <p>For example, if you tend to write fantasy, use fantastical elements, like hidden forests, magic spells, and an
        evil-doer to inspire your poetry. </p>
    <p>Start writing poetry using what you already know. Using this technique makes it much easier to start a poem.
        Additionally, examine and be present in your surroundings. Describe what you see, feel, smell. Use your senses
        to brainstorm possible poetry topics. </p>
    <p>If you need further inspiration, check out our <a
            href="https://www.fromwhisperstoroars.com/blog-1/2021/11/23/glossary-of-poetic-terms-50-definitions"
            target="_blank"> Glossary of Poetic Terms</a>. It may help nudge if you get stuck. </p>
    <h3>Poetry Writing Exercises </h3>
    <p>Still scratching your head when it comes to writing poetry? Try one or all of these poetry writing exercises.
        Writing exercises are a great way to get your creative juices flowing. </p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Look at an old photo. Write about everything not in the picture. Feel free to move to and from reality.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Describe a place you’ve never been to. Be as realistic as possible. The catch? It has to be a single word
            list.</li>
        <br>
        <li>What’s the last dream you remember? Using colors and smells to describe it.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Finishing the sentence and continue the story… “When my head hits the pillow…”</li>
        <br>
        <li>In 13 words, describe your oasis.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>These poetry writing exercises can be recycled. Get creative, and exploratory. Write what comes to mind. These
        prompts are meant to help you begin your poetry writing journey. There are no right or wrong ways to approach
        them. And remember, <a href="https://www.fromwhisperstoroars.com/blog-1/2018/9/5/the-art-of-revision"
            target="_blank"> revision</a> always comes later on.</p>
    <h3>What Makes a Good Poem?</h3>
    <p>This is an age-old question, and one that writers now and into the future will keep asking. </p>
    <p>But, honestly, what makes a good poem? </p>
    <p>If someone reads your poem, and feels something - anything - then you’ve written a good poem. </p>
    <p>Yes, some of the common types of poetry follow a set of “rules,” but you’re the writer, and when you’re the
        writer, you get to write whatever kind of poetry you want. </p>
    <p>No matter which forms you find yourself writing, all poetry elicits a response in readers. As a beginner, if you
        can stick to that rule of thumb, chances are you’re moving in the right poetic direction. </p>
    <h3>Ready to Write Poetry? </h3>
    <p><img src="blog-write-poetry-writing-poetry-for-beginners.jpg" alt="Poetry for bigginers"
            style="float: right;width: 250px;height: 150px;"> Poetry isn’t an inaccessible form of writing, but it can
        come across that way when you’re a beginner. Instead, writing poetry for beginners is pretty simple. Hopefully,
        this brief guide has made poetry feel more approachable. Now, it’s time to write poetry! </p>
